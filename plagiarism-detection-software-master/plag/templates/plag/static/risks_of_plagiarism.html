    <a name="risks"></a><h1>Risks of Plagiarism</h1>
    <p>As our <a href="{% url 'index' %}">homepage</a> alludes to, at least 23% of all content is plagiarized and/or infringes on copyright<sup><a href="#stat1">[1]</a></sup>. This sad statistic is indicative of an internet which is plagued by copyright infringement (albeit being an amazing resource overall).</p>
    <p>And unfortunately plagiarism is a growing problem. 55% of college presidents think that plagiarism has increased<sup><a href="#stat2">[2]</a></sup> and the news &amp; media routinely report on alleged plagiarism<sup><a href="#stat3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#stat4">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="#stat5">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="#stat6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#stat7">[7]</a></sup>. All content producers are harmed by plagiarism:</p>
    <a name="affects"></a><h2>Who Plagiarism Affects</h2>
    <ul class="imageList">
        <li><img src="{% static 'plag/img/Cust_Writer.jpg' %}" alt="Journalist" class="imgFloatL" />
            <span><strong>Writers, Authors &amp; Journalists</strong> - Whether you are a budding writer or a professional author/journalist, plagiarism is a massive risk to your livelihood.<br /><br />
            People might steal your content and rewrite parts of it without attribution, or they might even plagiarise the whole piece and claim it as their own. In the worst case, people might see the plagiarised copy and think that <em>you</em> plagiarised <em>their</em> work!</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <img src="{% static 'plag/img/Cust_WebOwner.jpg' %}" alt="Website owner" class="imgFloatR" />
            <span><strong>Website Owners &amp; Bloggers</strong> - Good quality content is paramount to any website &amp; blog - to draw visitors in, to keep them coming back, and helping secure a solid search engine rank.<br /><br />
            However plagiarism of your content can devalue your site by harming your site's uniqueness and cutting edge (since it looks like the person who plagiarised your content 'got there first'), and may even harm your search engine rank.<sup><a href="#stat8">[8]</a></sup></span>
        </li>
        <li><img src="{% static 'plag/img/Cust_Students.jpg' %}" alt="Students" class="imgFloatL" />
            <span><strong>Students</strong> - The majority of Colleges and Universities now employ plagiarism detection software<sup><a href="#stat9">[9]</a></sup>. And even if - like most students - you are honest and do not plagiarise, it is still possible to accidentally leave sentence fragments in your academic work that is too similar to other sources (such as textbooks or online sources).<br /><br />
            Hence it makes sense to run your essays and coursework through our plagiarism detection software to ensure that you never fall foul of academic integrity.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <img src="{% static 'plag/img/Cust_Company.jpg' %}" alt="Offices" class="imgFloatR" />
            <span><strong>Companies</strong> - Whether it's company secrets or boilerplate-esque business literature, it is imperative for companies to protect their written Intellectual Property.<br /><br />
            Failing to do so may undermine the business, make the company look like it uses unoriginal content or in the worse case, allow rivals to gain a competitive edge.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <img src="{% static 'plag/img/Cust_SEO.jpg' %}" alt="SEO" class="imgFloatL" />
            <span><strong>SEOs</strong> - Whilst search engines take steps to mitigate negative search engine effects from duplicate content, websites can still get adversely impacted by their content being plagiarised and stolen.<br /><br />
            This is especially true for newer websites and blogs, since your content might be stolen and put onto another website before the search engines scan your site. In this case, search engines such as Google might think that you copied the other site's content (albeit the reverse is true)!</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <img src="{% static 'plag/img/Cust_College.jpg' %}" alt="Princeton University" class="imgFloatR" />
            <span><strong>Colleges &amp; Teachers</strong> - As mentioned at the beginning, plagiarism is an ongoing and seemingly ever increasing problem - especially within academia. It is crucial to clamp down on plagiarism to defend the reputation of the College/Department and ensure that academic robustness is upheld.<br /><br />
            However thanks to the power of the internet, detecting plagiarism has much lower barrier of entries (and costs) than previously was the case.</span>
