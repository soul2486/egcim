    <h1>Website &amp; URL Protection</h1>
    <p>Our website &amp; URL protection can safeguard individual web pages or entire websites from plagiarism and content theft. Plagiarism Guard is used by website owners large and small, SEOs, bloggers and more.</p>
    <p>You can choose to scan each web page as frequently as you'd like - daily, weekly or monthly. Or you can 'mix and match' - for example, you can protect your most important pages daily, your standard pages weekly and your less important pages monthly. This allows you to tailor your website's plagiarism detection to your exact needs.</p>
    <a name="how_it_works"></a><h2>How it Works</h2>
    <img src="{% static 'plag/img/Homepage_thumb.jpg'%}" class="lightboxImg imgFloatL" data-full-url="{% static 'plag/img/Homepage_full.jpg'%}" alt="Homepage screenshot" />
    <p>Every day, week or month we scan &amp; analyse your web page(s) and then we automatically scour the internet, comparing your content to billions of other webpages, to detect any possible instances of plagiarism and content theft.</p>
    <p>Any possible matches are then run through our False Positive Protection technology to filter out any invalid plagiarism results, meaning that you will only see genuine cases of content theft.</p>
    <p>We then report all plagiarism results in your account and (optionally) email you with our findings.</p>
    <a name="how_to_order"></a><h2>How to Order</h2>
    <p>When <a href="{% url 'order' %}">placing an order</a>, you can either add each web page individually or bulk import them.</p>
    <a name="list_individually"></a><h3>List individually</h3>
    <img src="{% static 'plag/img/order_screens/Overall_thumb.jpg'%}" class="lightboxImg imgFloatL" data-full-url="{% static 'plag/img/order_screens/Overall_full.jpg'%}" alt="Order - overview of screen" />
    <p>Enter a website address (URL) in the left hand box which says 'Enter a URL' in it, and then choose how often we should scan this URL by selecting the relevant option in the scan frequency box that says 'Daily'.</p>
    <p>Then click 'Add resource to protect' and a new row will appear. Enter the next website address in this box, and change the scan frequency to suit your needs.</p>
    <p>Repeat these steps until you have added all web pages you would like to protect.</p>
    <a name="bulk_add"></a><h3>Bulk add</h3>
    <img src="{% static 'plag/img/order_screens/Bulk_thumb.jpg'%}" class="lightboxImg imgFloatL" data-full-url="{% static 'plag/img/order_screens/Bulk_full.jpg'%}" alt="Order - bulk add URLs" />
    <p>Instead of adding URLs one-by-one, you can also automatically bulk import website addresses. To do this, firstly click the "Bulk import new URLs" link.</p>
    <p>A new screen will appear in the middle of the page. If your website has a <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html" target="_blank">sitemap.xml</a>, enter the link to the sitemap and we will bulk import all URLs from there.</p>
    <p>If you don't have a sitemap.xml, you can either <a href="http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/" target="_blank">generate one</a> or insert URLs en masse by adding them to the 'List URLs' box (one URL per line). Click 'Submit' to add the links to the order form.</p>
    <a name="create_account"></a><h3>Create account &amp; checkout</h3>
    <p>Finally, enter your details in the 'Step 2 - Create an Account' section (you need an account to be able to view plagiarism results). 'Username', 'Email address' and 'Password' need to be filled in, whilst the first name and lastname fields are optional.</p>
    <p>After entering a username, if a red cross appears, the username you have chosen is already in use - so you will need to choose another one. After choosing a password, re-enter it in the 'Password (confirm) box to ensure you have typed your password in correctly.</p>
    <p>To finish, simply click 'Order' and your order will be placed and you will be taken to the payment page.</p>
    <a name="common_questions"></a><h2>Common Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>1) Can I only protect a single website/domain?</strong></p>
    <p>You can protect web pages from as many websites as you'd like. You can protect all webpages on a single website, or a range of web pages from various websites; it's entirely up to you.</p>
    <p><strong>2) Can I also protect documents?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, you can 'mix and match' and protect both web pages and <a href="{% url 'doc_prot' %}">documents</a>. When ordering click 'Add resource to protect' and you can choose either a website address (URL) or a file to protect.</p>
    <p><strong>3) What payment methods do you accept?</strong></p>
    <p>We accept payments via PayPal, through which you can pay from a range of sources - debit card, credit card, bank transfer and more. You don't need to register a PayPal account when paying through PayPal.</p>
    <p><strong>4) Can I easily cancel my order?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes. If you'd like to cancel for any reason, simply contact <a href="https://support.plagiarismguard.com/open.php">our billing department</a> and whilst we'll be sorry to see you go, we will take care of the rest. If you cancel in the first 30 days, you are entitled to a full refund through our 30 day money back guarantee.</p>
